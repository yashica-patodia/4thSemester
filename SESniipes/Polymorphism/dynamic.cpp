// SAME STATIC AND DYNAMIC BEHAVIOUR  FOR REFERENCES AND POINTERS
// Using the virtual keyword 
// 1)A virtual function is a member function which is declared within a base class and is re-defined(Overriden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function. 

// Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for function call.
// They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism
// Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in base class.
// The resolving of function call is done at Run-time.

// They are always defined in the base class and overridden in a derived class. It is not mandatory for the derived class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case, the base class version of the function is used
